//  Impec2D: Implicit Pressure Explicit Concentration in two spatial dimensions
//  
//  This software solves the incompressible equations for miscible displacement 
//  for two symmetric configurations using a finite-volume solver. The under-
//  lying equations exhibit a physical instability. Small numerical errors,
//  e.g. arising from the particular choice of grid, can therefore lead to 
//  completely different solutions. Please have a look at my dissertation 
//  (goe.pdf) for more information.
